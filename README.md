# pokemon-weakness-checker
Simple web tool to check weaknesses/resistances of different pokemon typings. 
I made this for myself since I have lots of trouble remembering type weaknesses and the problem is doubled when there are 2 types.
It has proven to be pretty useful for me so far.

TODO: Implement as a database. (Database is overkill for how little data there is but would be fun to implement)
